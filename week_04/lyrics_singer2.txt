She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover;I don't know what's going happen to you baby 
But I do know that I want you 
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky 
And I do know that I want you 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get 
Cause you do know that I love it 
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky 
And I do know that I want you 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 

You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me 
And you know that I love it 
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul 
And you do know that I want to 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Let's dance, let's shout;We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me;I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie
(is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take
Time and shame
I think the whole world
Of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing come true
(make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging
On my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl
That got away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But every time I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
(still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will
Have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who
Set you free

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away
I've got the feelin'

Can't let go
Can't let go

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away;So, we want to add a few words

Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
Kgb was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
We're talkin' danger

She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah

To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got yo' baby, ah

Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (it's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (ah)

Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)

Out on the floor

Rock the night away;Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Yeah I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
Hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven
Six, oh six

I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on
Let me tell y'all
I'm so tired now
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to walk on;There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw

Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy;She dances in these sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love;It's close to midnight 
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight 
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze 
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah

Oh oh oh

You hear the door slam 
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while 
You hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, oh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you 
Unless you change that number on your dial

Now is the time 
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night 
I'll save you from the terrors on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ohh baby (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night (Thriller night)

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;A buh-buh buh buh-buh

A buh-buh buh buh-buh

Things you never, never knew before

Like I before E except after C

And why two plus two makes four

[Chorus]
If you stay I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby don't leave me
Girl don't take your love from me
Oh girl

What can I say to make you stay
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you

[Chorus]

Tell me girl, it's not to late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl don't take your love
Don't take your love

Bridge:
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I'm gonna be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it's gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say
I really wanted to do
Girl, this time
Oh, oh girl I really mean it

[Chorus]

So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you

Don't leave me girl

Don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me
Oh, don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me;By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry.
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
Mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye, everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them,
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home.
Wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh,
That's my home and I like it that way.;(Oh no)
(Oh no, no)

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She said, "That's okay
Hey baby do as you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

A life that's so carefree

She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "But unlock the door

Close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb, was I
'Til you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was ('til now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until
Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was 'til now

Happy
Yeah, yeah, happy
La la la la, la la la
Yeah, happy
Ooh, happy
La la la la, la la la
Happy
Oh yeah, happy
La la la la, la la la;Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all going to end

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (gonna to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, prayers

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)

I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

She's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life;As he came into the window

Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true
And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasure
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
A cake and the crumbs

How lucky we are to be me and you
And forever is meant for so very few;Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like ferris wheels and spinning carousels

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth

Through rainbow colored eyes
Step right up its circus time
And get your moneys worth of love today

Get your tickets right away

I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all the time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else ?

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
Is it my brother ?
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
Is it my brother ?
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
To me I'm bothered
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away;We're takin' over

This is the mission to see it through
Don't point your finger

We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me;I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Flowers and butterflies
A rainbow lives beside it

A summer storm
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm

Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even lightening
Will be frightening my lion

No need to run, no need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin' you're a lion
In your own way be a lion

There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
There must be more that needs the light
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying see'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this;It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking
In the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before
You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to
Strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with
Forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on
Every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on
Your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on
The screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
Chiller
Thriller here tonight

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold

Now our separate mays we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay

And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around

Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy

If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there

Should you write and it's not there
Call on me
(Call on me) 

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
You can't close your, your mind!

(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Chime on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself
Brother
Hoo!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know, I've got to get
That man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to move! Chime on!
Chime on!
You got to
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it
(Change)
Make that change;I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way things could have been
Cause in it I don't care
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy has turned to pain

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 

I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine" ? 
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move! 

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' this way boy! 

I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say
Is that boy still alive?
The week in village what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And then get a taste of my blues! 

It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' this way! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies baby
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' no pain boy!;(Love is the thing you need)

Don't you stop, don't you stop;Bad news, bad news! 
I heard you're packing to leave! 
I come running right over
I just couldn't believe it
I couldn't believe it

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing

I've never done you no wrong
I never hit you when you're down
I always gave you good thing
I never ran around
I never ran around

[Chorus]

There's something you ought to know
If you're fixing to go
I can't make it without you
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no

[Chorus]

We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing;Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other 
 
Someone's evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile's trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He's been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel;(Think about, um, the generations 
And ah, say we want to make it a better place for our children
And our children's children so that they, they 
They, they know it's a better world for them
And think if they can make it a better place)

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place it was brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world (heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying

Enough is enough of this garbage

Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me

I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy, set me free

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't want to see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

Face the problems that we see,
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,
But we must live each day like it's the last.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle.
Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

That the cold nights can be warm
Just get along with your brother
(it's the shelter from the storm)

If you're standing in the sunshine
But still out in the rain
Let your heart strike a match
(cause love lights the flame)

[Chorus]
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let it burn forever and ever
Let love bring us together
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let us join our hands together
Make a chain that bonds forever

Motionless people gather dust
Stand in the rain and you'll rust

Let's try to show compassion
It's the time for us to learn
There will be a better tomorrow
Our reward is love in return

[Chorus];Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
In the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
Bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing the world beside me

So I got to be there, got to be there (got to be there) 
In the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "hello world!" (got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

You are my sunshine when it rains
And if the rain turns to snow
We'll still be on that friendship train

'Cause if our love affair should end (if our love affair should end)
I know I'll never find a friend
As great as you
Girl, I'm glad it's true

[Chorus]

Ooh, you're my best friend
Girl there will be no other
You're my friend and lover
(You're my best friend)

Don't you know I love ya
You're my friend and lover
Ooh, ooh girl there will always be someone to love ya
Someone who can love ya
(You're my best friend)

Yes you are
Yes you're my friend and lover
Girl there will be no other
(You're my best friend)

I'll be yours forever
You and me together;Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin' 
Her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

[Chorus]
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Within my heart, oh yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You torn apart, understand me now? 
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near

[Chorus]

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that baby
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine;Ah
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you

I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
Sweetest hangover

Yeah, I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get...over

Ooh, I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure

Sweet lovin'
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Don't call a doctor
Don't call her momma
Don't call her preacher

No, I don't need it
I don't want it

Sweet love, I love you
Sweet love, need love

If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it no
If there's a cure for this

Don't want to see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You want to be tough, better do what you can

So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair

If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble, just touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover, who makes me high
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

[Chorus]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
Yea
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)

It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it, then, won't you taste it

[Chorus]

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Whatever we do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it
She wants to give it

[Chorus]

Just open the door, and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

[Repeats: x6]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

I swear there's something about you baby
Makes me want

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Dare me;You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all I know
And that's why you're my pride and joy

And I'm tellin' the world
You're my (pride and joy) pride and joy (pride and joy)

My pride and joy (pride and joy)
Yeah baby (baby boy) Yeah baby (baby boy)

You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (pick me up) when I'm down (when I'm down)

You shake up the whole town (whole town)
And that's why (that's why)
I believe you're my (you're my) pride and joy (pride and joy)

Girl, don't you make 
Girl, don't you make 
Make me cry
Make me cry

You had my life
In the palm of your hand
Why you threw it away
I'll never ever understand

You took away the best part
The best part of me
You took away, you 
How cruel could you be?

You're just another heartache
I've got to learn to take
You're just another habit
I have to learn to break

Am I alone again?
Am I alone again?
Am I alone, alone, alone?

Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry
Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again
Again, again

The more I try, the more you hurt me
Why?
Tell me why
Tell me why

I can take an Aspirin
For a bad headache
But what pill for loneliness can I take?

I can seal to you
Just like cellophane
But I need you, baby
Like a star needs fame

You're not another habit
I have to learn to break
Let's try to patch it up
Before it's too late

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love, in love, in love

Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry
Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again

The more I try, the more you hurt me
Why?
Tell me why
Tell me why

The more I try, the more you hurt me
Why?
Tell me why
Tell me why;Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood;I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Oh ooh 
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Oh ooh 

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)

The world's a better place
(The world's a better place)
'Cause you came in time,
('Cause you came in time)
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
(You took away the rain and brought the sunshine)
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
(I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time)
Uh uh

I like the way how you're holdin' me,

You'll see;She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

And she's, out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked, deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my, life;So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected

So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said darling, won't you please

I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong.

Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through

But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo

I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, yeah
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms

Now yes says senorita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

Yeah, baby
So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
It's great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ow!

It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms, yeah
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah;When I (when I) had you (had you)
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And girl since
Since you been away
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

I, I, I, I
Should have never ever
Ever made you cry
And girl since
Since you been gone
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think
I don't think
I'm gonna make it
All my life (all my life)
All my life, yeah (all my life)
Belongs to you only
Come on and take it girl
Come on and take it
Because
All
All I can do
All I can do
Since you been gone is cry
And you, oooh
Will never wonder
And worry your pretty little head
About what I do

Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you;All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Sue me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kick me, don't you black or white me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy, set me free

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't want to see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life, they just don't want to see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kick me, don't you wrong or right me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us (we're deep in fire)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us (I'm here to remind you)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about
All I want to say is that they don't really care about
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us;There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
There's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell

[Chorus:]
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
There's such a man
He's not like me and you

And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

[Chorus]

Did you know, this man can do anything?
There's such a man
I wish that we could bring

[Chorus]

There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
There's such a man
He's not like me and you
And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

This is the man [Repeat x 3];Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You persuaded me to love you,
And I did, 
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead,
Into your arms I fell, 
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there.
Spoken:  You closed the door of your heart and turned the key,
locked your love away from me.
 
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You made me love you, 
And oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You said loving you would make life beautiful 
with each passing day,
But as soon as love came into my heart, 
you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
 

;Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (you are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
(You and me) I am here to stay

For you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
For I am here with you though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

Someone like you to call mine (yeah, yeah);It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl!
But all the while you hear the creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures calling, the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow!

(I'm gonna thrill ya tonight)
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'alls neighborhood

I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, ooh baby
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, oh darlin'
Thriller night, baby, ooh!

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom

And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears;Enjoy yourself

You sittin' over there
Starin' into space
While people are dancin'
Dancin' all over the place

Let yourself go

Que nadie te querra
Como yo
Tu me haces sentir
Deseos de vivir

En mi corazon
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado
Con tu pasion
Me conoces bien
Y sabas tambien
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estas
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida
Si tu te vas
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo se
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo
Vivo por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tu
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de
Lo que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Cambiaremos el mundo mañana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti
Todo mi amor eres tu
(Now, baby, oh)
Todo mi amor eres tu
(If I ain't stop)
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu;Moonlight took me by surprise
'light coming from your eyes
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

I know I've been here before
You go, then you come back for more
It's a mystery how you disappear
Like a shadow in the night
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Midnight images of you
You slipped, slipped into my room
Could be magic, could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Your voice whispers in the dark
You talk, talking to my heart
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]

When the morning comes
Wake me with your love
Let me know that I'm not dreamin'
Tell me this is real
Show me how you feel
Say it's what we both believe in

[Chorus];Looking in my mirror 
Took me by surprise 
I can't help but see you 
Running often through my mind 
Helpless like a baby 
Sensual disguise 
I can't help but love you 
It is getting better all the time 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

Love to run my fingers 
Softly while you sigh 
Love came and possessed you 
Bringing sparkles to your eyes 

Like a trip to heaven 
Heaven is the prize 
And I'm so glad I found you 
You're an angel in disguise 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no;We've got blue skies, we've got blue skies

It seems like only yesterday
You gave your love to me
And we made a vow that through the years
Our love would always be.

Whenever doubts would fill my mind
You'd brush my fears away
Look into my eyes and hold me close
And this is what you'd say...

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

The pleasant dreams we shared
Made our love stronger with each day
And the fears that haunted me
Seemed like a million miles away.

When friends we knew would come to me
With lies about your love
I'd tell them happiness and sunny skies
Are all we're thinking of

We're so in love
We're thinking of.

Blue skies...
Blue skies...

I see you there, you're kissing him
How can this really be?
Well, I guess it's time to realize
My dreams are more to me

And as I walk off thinking
What a fool I must have been
Like an echo from my lips today
I hear you telling him...

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

[Repeat: x2]
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies, oh baby;I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
Ay, uh, uh, whoa, whoa
Whoa

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

It feels so right (girl)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (like I)

I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus 
Underneath the mistletoe last night 
She didn't see me creep 
Down the stairs to have a peep 
She thought that I was tucked up 
In my bedroom, fast asleep 

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus 
Underneath his beard so snowy white 
Oh, what a laugh it would have been 
If Daddy had only seen 
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night 

He saw mommy kissing, kissin', kissin' Santa Claus 
I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus

What you say, say, say, what you say, say, say

You never ever worry and you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face, these tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say that I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day that you'll see things, girl, like I do
What can I do, girl, to get through to you
'Cause I love you (love you) baby (baby)

You, you, you can never say that I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day that you'll see things, girl, like I do;Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could have kept you happy

I'd do anything

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell,
When two hearts belong so well

Maybe the walls will tumble
And sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in this cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
Sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
(I don't know)
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Oh... Oh, oh, oh...
The sun in me
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...
All these words that young lovers say...

And maybe the walls will crumble
And sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I need you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
(I don't know)
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Baby, you can never go
Baby, you gotta know
See that you never go
That's for all time
Baby, you never know
(I don't know)
That's for all time...;Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine

I know she's mine (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
It's really just a waste of time

Because she's mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time (your time, don't waste your time, don't your time, don't)

I love you more than he (take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly (loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
That she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

'Cause the doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

She love the way I love her low
The way I love her high
She love to say hello
And never say goodbye
I call her mommy
And she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike but
She love the way I rock her
And you know, you know, you know I really care
(You know, you know, you know I care, oh, girl)
And she know, she know the love is right here
And I know, I know the love is real true
And now they know, they know just how the Willie do

They like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock

Every time you see

Do you remember
When we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk?
You know
We'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said? 
Like, I love you so, I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring?
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me

After dark
Do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Yeah, yeah, woo
Remember the time;Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light 
From one more violent crime 
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue 
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die 
Did god say that you you could decide ?
You saw he didn't run 
And then my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village 
Within a distant land
Lies a cool boy with his broken toy 
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking 
His father grabs his hand
Screaming crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why 
Why his mother had to die
Why did these soldiers come here for ? 
If they're for peace why is there war ? 
Did god say that they could decide 
Who will live and who will die ?
All my mama ever did 
Was try to take care of her kids
When innocence is standing by 
Watching people loosing lives
It seem as if we have no voice 
It's time for us to make a choice
Only god could decide 
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done 
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Thank god I care for me
Thank god I care for you
Thank god I came from you babe
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and by your side
Deep in my soul
It's so big and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let god decide, 
It's going on baby
Just let god decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta it from us 
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough;Give me
Give me
Give me

Give me half a chance
Oh your life's gonna have new meaning
Yes it will
Why don't you give me half a chance?
Give me half a chance

I'll prove my love to you, it's true
Come on and give me half a chance
Oh, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will
If you would give me half a chance
Give me half a chance
There's so much I would do for you

Love put us two together
But we don't know how to stay

Give me half a chance
If you just wait and see
Give me half a chance
Your heart will be set free
Give me half a chance

For I know that you'd want me
If you'd only
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance
Give me half a chance, give me half a chance

Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

So pray for all the lost children
Let's pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home;Saturday night at eight o'clock 
I know where I'm gonna go, 
I'm gonna pick my baby up,
And take her to the picture show.
Ev'rybody in the neighborhood 
Is dressin' up to be there too, 
And we're gonna be a ball 
Just like we always do. 
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby i
n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
 
Movies are better than ever, 
And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?

Every healthy smile

In promising salvation, is near this time
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters, show we know how
Now tell me

Me here tonight
'Til it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine

She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

Susie got your number, and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my, take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain't your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby;Oh baby, now, I've been watchin' you, girl
When you dance, you steal the show
Just like you stole my heart
When the lights were low
All the guys are waiting
Pleading just to hold you tight
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

'Cause now you're in my arms, girl
You thrill my soul
C'mon, hold me close
Rock me slow
Baby, never let me go

[CHORUS]
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Can satisfy you
Gonna 'lectrify you
C'mon, let me prove it
Show you I can do it

I've been walkin' like a shadow
Right behind you, by myself
While you've been walking home
With someone else
Don't you know it hurts me
Seeing you with other guys
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

When the party's over, let me walk you home
I'll hold you close
Rock you slow
Never, never let you go

Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Oh, all, all mine, mine, mine, mine, yeah 

Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy, yeah 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Hey, what you say, girl?
Can we slip away, girl?
I want to get into you
Let me do it to you, oh

(Oh, baby, make tonight all mine)
(Oh, I've waited such a long, long time)
(Baby, I...);I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all the time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else?

(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
To me I'm bothered
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away;Reach out and touch
Reach out and touch

Darlin' just relax
You melt me like hot candle wax
One touch and my whole body melts
You just say, you say you can't express yourself

Oh, just keep doin' what you're doin'
Fancy words will only ruin it
Touch (touch me)
That very special touch
If I satisfy you (if I satisfy you)
How can you satisfy me baby

How you satisfy me;Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (who?), the IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)

Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

When you cry part of me's gonna die;There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, I didn't do that

We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the children, shalingin

I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you my baby

Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
She's invincible, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
You see that girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible;Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)

Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)

So come and go with me
Two on the town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it

The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine);Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
"I do"

"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do;Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for? 
Do you know?

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to? 
Do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for? 
Do you know?;Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me? I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

No, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

(No, no) no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait (no)

Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone (you're beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone;Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Told me
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Lead me) Hold me
(Love me and feed me) Yeah, yeah

(Show me you care) Yeah, yeah

(Hold me) Woo
(Lay your head lowly) I get lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly) I get lonely, yeah, yeah
(Carry me there) Carry me there

(Lead me) Woo
(Love me and feed me) Lift me up, hold me up
(Kiss me and free me) Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
(I will feel blessed) Yeah;Tired of injustice, tired of the scheme
Life is disgustin' so what does it mean, Debbie
You kick to me down I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds the whole system sucks, Debbie

Peek in the shadow, I come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but ya I care about mine
I've got to get stronger and I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Tired of tellin' the story your way

Keep changin' the rules while I playin' the game
I can't take it much longer I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't make me wanna scream, baby

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw

You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it, no

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

;You're givin' me true love
And everyday I thank the Lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony, baby
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony;Can't find no rhyme to it all
But still we keep on trying
The why and where of it all
Inside you the answer is lying

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade (?) of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in
Shine, shine, shine, shine.

Don't take the easy way out
Believe there is a Maker
Don't be a body of doubt
In whom does live a faker

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in

A soul without love
Is a soul without meaning
And the Lord up above
He'll destroy every being 

Reach in...
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

;If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If'n I was God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you

Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
The hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect

Truth be told the grassy knoll
The blackmail story in all your glory

It's Slander
You say it's not a sword

They say he's homosexual

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
The headline stories of
All your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
If you don't go and buy it

To read it sanctifies it

You're so damn disrespectable;If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand

I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do

If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 

Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why

I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you

I only want to show you
That i'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...;I don't know how many stars there are
Up in the heavenly sky

You're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby

Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl

Maybe she won't
Maybe you're all I need to get by

But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Gotta leave this empty life
Got a ticket in my hand
So look for me tonight

 {Michael, sample}
 Love you
 Love you
 Love you girl
 Make me fly away;Here we come yo, here we come

I'm just a brotherman, descendant of the motherland
I f*ck with blackberries and dimes and butter tens
Good on my right and trouble on my other hand
Life is a tight rope I'm dyin' the balance in
And by the end hopefully I be the balance-man
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
It's outta function I see girls that can top it off
I hold mines while these cowboys pop it off
You just a movie-dude claimin' that you pop-soft
This shit's like cold grits without the hot sauce
This government seems to me like it's off course

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Like it's off course)
Come on come on
Let's move (this government) and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Ride with me, come on)
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Your dubious style may rock for right now
But in the long run, you really lost one
Jamaica, Queens-man land of the tossed gun
It's never easy police nah sees we
Go through the checkpoints birds flip to po nine
I got a bad bird nicknamed her sunshine
I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime
Into the right tunes we hit the right rhymes
I dig her fashion smash into my memory
And in the club shorty stays real into me
A humble dude and never will pretend to be
The type of artist that's desired for the industry
Came in this fucka me and I'm a leave me
And in the end B you would believe me that I'm a leave me
So what's a industry if the listeners will always stand beside me?

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Here we come yo, here we come

Gather around, the Renissance man has finally appeared
And I'm astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul
They are the reason MCs but none on the level
Other you're the vocalist, precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing inpure emcees, plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

Rap, Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap
It is the Renaissance rap

Now lookin at ya clock, you know that it's time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P
That be G-O-D, and I be T-I-P
The promoter of the flyness, witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness
Don't'cha ever forget, who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suh'thin that you can't recover up from
You better a-joinin the force because we can't be done
Listen, we on this mission and it's a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo
It's the Renaissance;Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
"I do"

"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I,
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do;One, two, three, four
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world
I'll feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes for sure
It is real

And it feels as though I've seen your face one thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with you eyes
But you say you're gonna leave it for yourself
Oh
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

This is it
I can say
I'm the light of your world
Run away
We can feel
This is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel

And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me that you don't want me hanging around
Many times wanna do it here before
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

This is it
I can feel
I'm to light up the world
This is real
Feel my song
We can say
And I tell you can feel that way

And I feels as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you saw my face yourself
And you said want to go with you on a while
And I know that it's really for myself
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on dear please understand
Oh yeah

I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan;I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was high-top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know, I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet Magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, ah
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side, I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know, Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, wee, baby, my baby loves me
My baby needs me
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh, my baby loves me

;Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And it told her out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Oh!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And a man is out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us

Oh!

Why did you let him get away?

Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back

Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?;She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover;I don't know what's going happen to you baby 
But I do know that I want you 
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky 
And I do know that I want you 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get 
Cause you do know that I love it 
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky 
And I do know that I want you 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 
Shake you body down to the ground 

You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me 
And you know that I love it 
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul 
And you do know that I want to 

Let's dance, let's shout 
Let's dance, let's shout;We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me;I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie
(is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take
Time and shame
I think the whole world
Of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing come true
(make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging
On my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl
That got away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But every time I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
(still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will
Have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who
Set you free

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away
I've got the feelin'

Can't let go
Can't let go

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away;So, we want to add a few words

Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
Kgb was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend

My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Yeah I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
Hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven
Six, oh six

I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on
Let me tell y'all
I'm so tired now
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to walk on;There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw

Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy;She dances in these sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love;It's close to midnight 
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight 
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze 
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah

Oh oh oh

You hear the door slam 
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while 
You hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, oh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you 
Unless you change that number on your dial

Now is the time 
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night 
I'll save you from the terrors on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
Chiller, thriller here tonight

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ohh baby (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, all night, oh baby
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, all night (oh baby)
Thriller night (Thriller night)

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;A buh-buh buh buh-buh

A buh-buh buh buh-buh

Oh, girl please don't leave me

[Chorus]
If you stay I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby don't leave me
Girl don't take your love from me
Oh girl

Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you

Tell me girl, it's not to late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl don't take your love
Don't take your love

Bridge:
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I'm gonna be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it's gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say

Oh, don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me;By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry.
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
Mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye, everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them,
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home.
Wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh,
That's my home and I like it that way.;(Oh no)
(Oh no, no)

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She said, "That's okay
Hey baby do as you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She said, "That's okay
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far

If you make me a star?

She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
Now I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

Close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb, was I
'Til you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was ('til now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until
Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was 'til now

Happy
Yeah, yeah, happy
La la la la, la la la
Yeah, happy
Ooh, happy
La la la la, la la la
Happy
Oh yeah, happy
La la la la, la la la;Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all going to end

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (gonna to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, prayers

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (going to take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm going to need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Aah, ooh

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son

What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine

All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores

Although I know we've drifted far

She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

She's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life;As he came into the window

Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true
And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasure
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
A cake and the crumbs

How lucky we are to be me and you
And forever is meant for so very few;Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see

I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all the time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else ?

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
Is it my brother ?
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
Is it my brother ?
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Who is it ?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it ?)
To me I'm bothered
(Who is it ?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it ?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else ?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away;We're takin' over

Another part of me

We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me;I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white

Flowers and butterflies
A rainbow lives beside it

A summer storm
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm

Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even lightening
Will be frightening my lion

No need to run, no need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin' you're a lion
In your own way be a lion

We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

Ben you're always running here and there (here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere (anywhere)
If you ever look behind 
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
(I used to say "I" and "me")
(Now it's "us", now it's "we")

Ben most people would turn you away (turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (a word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again 
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben;There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
There must be more that needs the light
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying see'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this;It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking
In the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before
You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to
Strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with
Forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on
Every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on
Your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on
The screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
Chiller
Thriller here tonight

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold

Now our separate mays we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay

And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around

Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy

If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there

Should you write and it's not there
Call on me
(Call on me) 

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me...;Don't let it get you down

For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change!

I'm asking him to change his ways

Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
You can't close your, your mind!

(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

Oh no, no no

And she was well aware
I was excited about the way things could have been
Cause in it I don't care
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy has turned to pain

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 

I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine" ? 
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move! 

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' this way boy! 

I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say
Is that boy still alive?
The week in village what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And then get a taste of my blues! 

It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' this way! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies baby
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' no pain boy!;(Love is the thing you need)

Oh, you can't get no satisfaction
When your mind is overacting
And you don't give your self the love you need

And get down, down, down
With some good ol' funky, funky love
(Love is the thing you need) Fellas
(Love is the thing you need) Ah, hit it,

If you wanna live a happy, happy life yeah, yeah

Oh, there ain't no doubt about it

Sing it to me children

(Love is the thing you need) One more time, yeah

Once a day, twice a day, everyday
(Love is the thing you need) What you say now
Once a day, twice a day, good God, everyday
(Love is the thing you need) You gotta, gotta have love
You gotta, gotta have love
You gotta, gotta have love
Y'all know what I'm talkin' about (Love is the thing you need)
You gotta, gotta have love

Don't you stop, don't you stop;Bad news, bad news! 
I heard you're packing to leave! 
I come running right over
I just couldn't believe it
I couldn't believe it

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kicking away? 
We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing

I've never done you no wrong
I never hit you when you're down
I always gave you good thing
I never ran around
I never ran around

[Chorus]

There's something you ought to know
If you're fixing to go
I can't make it without you
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no no

[Chorus]

We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing;Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other 
 
Someone's evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile's trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He's been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel;(Think about, um, the generations 
And ah, say we want to make it a better place for our children
And our children's children so that they, they 
They, they know it's a better world for them
And think if they can make it a better place)

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place it was brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world

Face the problems that we see,
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,
But we must live each day like it's the last.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle.
Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

It ain't too much for me to;Mother earth told the people
That the cold nights can be warm
Just get along with your brother
(it's the shelter from the storm)

If you're standing in the sunshine
But still out in the rain
Let your heart strike a match
(cause love lights the flame)

[Chorus]
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let it burn forever and ever
Let love bring us together
Let it shine so bright
The eternal light
Let us join our hands together
Make a chain that bonds forever

Motionless people gather dust
Stand in the rain and you'll rust

Let's try to show compassion
It's the time for us to learn
There will be a better tomorrow
Our reward is love in return

[Chorus];Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
In the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
Bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing the world beside me

So I got to be there, got to be there (got to be there) 
In the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "hello world!" (got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
Where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home (home, she's home)

You and me together;Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin' 
Her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

[Chorus]
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Within my heart, oh yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You torn apart, understand me now? 
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near

[Chorus]

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that baby
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine;Ah

If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble, just touch me

You had my life
In the palm of your hand
Why you threw it away
I'll never ever understand

You took away the best part
The best part of me
You took away, you 
How cruel could you be?

You're just another heartache
I've got to learn to take
You're just another habit
I have to learn to break

Am I alone again?
Am I alone again?
Am I alone, alone, alone?

Just like cellophane
But I need you, baby

Why?
Tell me why
Tell me why;Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood;I was alone in the dark when I met ya

You'll see;She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

And she's, out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked, deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my, life;So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected

So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said darling, won't you please

I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong.

Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through

But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo

I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby, yeah
It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms

Now yes says senorita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

Yeah, baby
So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
It's great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ow!

It's great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms, yeah
It's great to be here in your arms
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah;When I (when I) had you (had you)
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And girl since
Since you been away
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

I, I, I, I
Should have never ever
Ever made you cry
And girl since
Since you been gone
Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think
I don't think
I'm gonna make it
All my life (all my life)
All my life, yeah (all my life)
Belongs to you only
Come on and take it girl
Come on and take it
Because
All
All I can do
All I can do
Since you been gone is cry
And you, oooh
Will never wonder
And worry your pretty little head
About what I do

Dont'cha know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you;All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Sue me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kick me, don't you black or white me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy, set me free

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't want to see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life, they just don't want to see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kick me, don't you wrong or right me

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us (we're deep in fire)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us (I'm here to remind you)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
All I want to say is that they don't really care about
All I want to say is that they don't really care about
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us;There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
There's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell

[Chorus:]
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
There's such a man
He's not like me and you

And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

[Chorus]

Did you know, this man can do anything?
There's such a man
I wish that we could bring

[Chorus]

There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
There's such a man
He's not like me and you
And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

This is the man [Repeat x 3];Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You persuaded me to love you,
And I did, 
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead,
Into your arms I fell, 
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there.
Spoken:  You closed the door of your heart and turned the key,
locked your love away from me.
 
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You made me love you, 
And oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You said loving you would make life beautiful 
with each passing day,
But as soon as love came into my heart, 
you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
 

;Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (you are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
(You and me) I am here to stay

For you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
For I am here with you though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone not alone, oh;Uh!

Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl!
But all the while you hear the creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures calling, the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow!

(I'm gonna thrill ya tonight)
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'alls neighborhood

I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, ooh baby
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, oh darlin'
Thriller night, baby, ooh!

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom

And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears;Enjoy yourself

Y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece
Tu amor aparece
Y me hare feliz
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que nadie te querra
Como yo
Tu me haces sentir
Deseos de vivir
Junto a ti por siempre
Tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama
Tu eres quien gana
En mi corazon
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado
Con tu pasion
Me conoces bien
Y sabas tambien
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estas
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida
Si tu te vas
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo se
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo
Vivo por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tu
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de
Lo que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Cambiaremos el mundo mañana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti
Todo mi amor eres tu
(Now, baby, oh)
Todo mi amor eres tu

Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo que das tu

'light coming from your eyes
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

I know I've been here before
You go, then you come back for more
It's a mystery how you disappear
Like a shadow in the night
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'
Are you too good to be true
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Midnight images of you
You slipped, slipped into my room
Could be magic, could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

Your voice whispers in the dark
You talk, talking to my heart
Are you with me
Am I here with you
Are we in paradise
Tell me I'm not dreamin'

[Chorus]

When the morning comes
Wake me with your love
Let me know that I'm not dreamin'
Tell me this is real
Show me how you feel
Say it's what we both believe in

[Chorus];Looking in my mirror 
Took me by surprise 
I can't help but see you 
Running often through my mind 
Helpless like a baby 
Sensual disguise 
I can't help but love you 
It is getting better all the time 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

Love to run my fingers 
Softly while you sigh 
Love came and possessed you 
Bringing sparkles to your eyes 

Like a trip to heaven 
Heaven is the prize 
And I'm so glad I found you 
You're an angel in disguise 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no 

I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it even if I could 
I can't help it if I wanted to 
I wouldn't help it, no;We've got blue skies, we've got blue skies

It seems like only yesterday
You gave your love to me
And we made a vow that through the years
Our love would always be.

Whenever doubts would fill my mind
You'd brush my fears away
Look into my eyes and hold me close
And this is what you'd say...

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

The pleasant dreams we shared
Made our love stronger with each day
And the fears that haunted me
Seemed like a million miles away.

When friends we knew would come to me
With lies about your love
I'd tell them happiness and sunny skies
Are all we're thinking of

We're so in love
We're thinking of.

Blue skies...
Blue skies...

I see you there, you're kissing him
How can this really be?
Well, I guess it's time to realize
My dreams are more to me

And as I walk off thinking
What a fool I must have been
Like an echo from my lips today
I hear you telling him...

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

[Repeat: x2]
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies, oh baby;I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
Ay, uh, uh, whoa, whoa
Whoa

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

It feels so right (girl)

I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus 
Underneath the mistletoe last night 
She didn't see me creep 
Down the stairs to have a peep 
She thought that I was tucked up 
In my bedroom, fast asleep 

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus 
Underneath his beard so snowy white 
Oh, what a laugh it would have been 
If Daddy had only seen 
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night 

He saw mommy kissing, kissin', kissin' Santa Claus 
I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus 
And I'm gonna tell my dad 

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus 
Underneath his beard so snowy white

Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could have kept you happy

I'd do anything

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell,
When two hearts belong so well

Maybe the walls will tumble
And sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in this cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you are there

And maybe the walls will tumble
Sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I love you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
(I don't know)
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Oh... Oh, oh, oh...
The sun in me
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...
All these words that young lovers say...

And maybe the walls will crumble
And sun may refuse to shine
When I say, I need you
Baby, you've gotta know
That's for all time
(I don't know)
Baby you gotta know
(I don't know)
That's for all time

Baby, you can never go
Baby, you gotta know
See that you never go
That's for all time
Baby, you never know
(I don't know)
That's for all time...;Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)

I know she's mine (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

Because she's mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

But I love you endlessly (loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
That she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The way I love her high
She love to say hello
And never say goodbye
I call her mommy
And she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike but
She love the way I rock her

It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk?
You know
We'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said? 
Like, I love you so, I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring?
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?

Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Yeah, yeah, woo
Remember the time;Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light 
From one more violent crime 
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue 
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die 
Did god say that you you could decide ?
You saw he didn't run 
And then my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village 
Within a distant land
Lies a cool boy with his broken toy 
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking 
His father grabs his hand
Screaming crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why 
Why his mother had to die
Why did these soldiers come here for ? 
If they're for peace why is there war ? 
Did god say that they could decide 
Who will live and who will die ?
All my mama ever did 
Was try to take care of her kids
When innocence is standing by 
Watching people loosing lives
It seem as if we have no voice 
It's time for us to make a choice
Only god could decide 
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done 
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Thank god I care for me
Thank god I care for you
Thank god I came from you babe
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and by your side
Deep in my soul
It's so big and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let god decide, 
It's going on baby
Just let god decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta it from us 
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough;Give me
Give me
Give me

Give me half a chance
Oh your life's gonna have new meaning
Yes it will
Why don't you give me half a chance?
Give me half a chance

Come on and give me half a chance
Oh, I'm gonna win you over, yes I will

Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

So pray for all the lost children
Let's pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home;Saturday night at eight o'clock 
I know where I'm gonna go, 
I'm gonna pick my baby up,
And take her to the picture show.
Ev'rybody in the neighborhood 
Is dressin' up to be there too, 
And we're gonna be a ball 
Just like we always do. 
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby i
n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
 
Movies are better than ever, 
And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?

(Can you see what's going down? Can you feel it in your bones?)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters, show we know how
Now tell me

Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you
Now tell me

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it;Alone tonight
Me here tonight
'Til it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine

She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

Susie got your number, and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my, take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain't your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby;Oh baby, now, I've been watchin' you, girl
When you dance, you steal the show
Just like you stole my heart
When the lights were low
All the guys are waiting
Pleading just to hold you tight
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

'Cause now you're in my arms, girl
You thrill my soul
C'mon, hold me close
Rock me slow
Baby, never let me go

[CHORUS]
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy
Just gimme a try 
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby, I...)
Can satisfy you
Gonna 'lectrify you
C'mon, let me prove it
Show you I can do it

I've been walkin' like a shadow
Right behind you, by myself
While you've been walking home
With someone else
Don't you know it hurts me
Seeing you with other guys
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight

When the party's over, let me walk you home
I'll hold you close
Rock you slow
Never, never let you go

Oh, baby, make tonight all mine

(Oh, I've waited such a long, long time)
(Baby, I...);I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all the time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else?

(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
To me I'm bothered
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away;Reach out and touch
Reach out and touch

Darlin' just relax
You melt me like hot candle wax
One touch and my whole body melts
You just say, you say you can't express yourself

Oh, just keep doin' what you're doin'
Fancy words will only ruin it
Touch (touch me)
That very special touch
If I satisfy you (if I satisfy you)
How can you satisfy me baby

Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (who?), the IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

I always feel like somebody's watching me

Give It Baby

Come On
You Really Give It Too Me
Got To Give It
You Just Want To Give It;Free and untamed that's how I've grown
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild

[Chorus]
I'm Johnny Raven by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

[Chorus]

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by and by
I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die;There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, I didn't do that

We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah

We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it

We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking

I see you walk by with other guys,
Step, step, steppin' on my toes
The whole world's talkin' 'bout
How I'm your stand by Santa Claus

But ooh, your kisses thrill me,
Sure love your angel eyes
The devil in you kills me,
But I made up my mind

I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby I'll be your sugar daddy,
Give you kissin' when it's missin', yeah

'Cause I got a sweet tooth for your love

S-U-G, listen to me, listen to me
A-R, what it is, what it is
D-A-D-D-Y spells I'm your good thing

King of fools they crowned me
And that crown just fits me to a "T"
'Cause you only come around me
Just to pick up what you need

You just play on my emotions,
With please, please, pretty please
Well everybody's go the notion
I'm your goodwill industry (Oh Henry)

He's driving me nuts,
While I'm giving you the candy,
He's gettin' all your love
(Mary Jane said)
Mary Jane said I'm just your lollipop, sucker
Well my flavor's long lasting girl,
It ain't never gonna stop, no

Baby I'm a fool
Just a fool in love with you (I can't help myself, oh no)
Oh no I can't help myself

I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby I'll be your sugar daddy,
Give you kissin' when it's missin'
I'll even let you drive my caddy,
When I get one baby
Oh oh oh I'm gonna be your sugar daddy,
Give you honey, all my money
Well L.A. to Cincinnati
That's how far I'd crawl for you;There's a steam beat

Gonna burn this disco out;If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you my baby

Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
She's invincible, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
You see that girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible;Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)

Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)

So come and go with me
Two on the town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover
You know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
I don't believe it

The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine);Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
"I do"

"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do;Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for? 
Do you know?

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to? 
Do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for? 
Do you know?;Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me? I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

No, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

(No, no) no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait (no)

Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone (you're beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone;Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Told me
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Lead me) Hold me
(Love me and feed me) Yeah, yeah
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah

(Save me) Lead me
(Heal me and bathe me) Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there

(Lift me) Told me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) Yeah
(Show me you care) Yeah, yeah

(Hold me) Woo
(Lay your head lowly) I get lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly) I get lonely, yeah, yeah
(Carry me there) Carry me there

(Lead me) Woo
(Love me and feed me) Lift me up, hold me up
(Kiss me and free me) Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
(I will feel blessed) Yeah;Tired of injustice, tired of the scheme
Life is disgustin' so what does it mean, Debbie
You kick to me down I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds the whole system sucks, Debbie

Peek in the shadow, I come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but ya I care about mine
I've got to get stronger and I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Tired of tellin' the story your way

I can't take it much longer I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't make me wanna scream, baby

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
...

;You're givin' me true love
And everyday I thank the Lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony, baby
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony;Can't find no rhyme to it all
But still we keep on trying
The why and where of it all
Inside you the answer is lying

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade (?) of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in
Shine, shine, shine, shine.

Don't take the easy way out
Believe there is a Maker
Don't be a body of doubt
In whom does live a faker

Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

Reach in (reach in)
Put away that shade of sin
And let love shine in
And let love shine in

A soul without love
Is a soul without meaning
And the Lord up above
He'll destroy every being 

Reach in...
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'

(Etc., etc., - they vamp till the end);Ahh, I love it, oww

;If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If'n I was God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you
If'n I was God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand;You better make a way for the young folks

Here we come, and we're so alive.
We're here for business buddy,and don't won't no jive.
Brighter tomorrows are in our eyes
You better make a way for the young folks
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We say yes
And you say no
We ask you why
And you close the door
My old friend I thought you knew by now, yeah
You can't do that to the young folks
Oh, no, no, no, no

You might not like it
But I've got to tell you

You may not like it but I've to tell you
I've got to tell you, na na na na;Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
The hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
The blackmail story in all your glory

It's Slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it
And you don't have to eat it
To buy it is to feed it
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
The headline stories of
All your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
If you don't go and buy it
Then they won't glorify it
To read it sanctifies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it
Then they won't glorify it
To read it sanctifies it
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine

You're so damn disrespectable;If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand

I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do

If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 

Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why

I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you

I only want to show you
That i'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...;I don't know how many stars there are
Up in the heavenly sky
I only know my heaven is here on earth
Each time you look into my eyes
The way you do baby

Thank you thank you baby
My beautiful bird you have flown away
I held you to tight I can see

You're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you

You are the four seasons of my life
But maybe tomorrow you'll change your mind girl
Maybe tomorrow you'll come back to my arms girl

Maybe she won't
Maybe you're all I need to get by
No one else can make me cry
The way you do baby, cause

You are the book that I read each day
You are the song that I sing
Gonna sing it to you

Maybe tomorrow;My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times

Shining everywhere
But I don't see the light
And no one seems to care

That's why I'm packing up again
Gotta leave this empty life
Got a ticket in my hand
So look for me tonight

Baby, I'm coming home
Coming home

I'm just a brotherman, descendant of the motherland
I f*ck with blackberries and dimes and butter tens
Good on my right and trouble on my other hand
Life is a tight rope I'm dyin' the balance in
And by the end hopefully I be the balance-man
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
It's outta function I see girls that can top it off
I hold mines while these cowboys pop it off
You just a movie-dude claimin' that you pop-soft
This shit's like cold grits without the hot sauce
This government seems to me like it's off course

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Like it's off course)
Come on come on
Let's move (this government) and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
(Ride with me, come on)
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Your dubious style may rock for right now
But in the long run, you really lost one
Jamaica, Queens-man land of the tossed gun
It's never easy police nah sees we
Go through the checkpoints birds flip to po nine
I got a bad bird nicknamed her sunshine
I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime
Into the right tunes we hit the right rhymes
I dig her fashion smash into my memory
And in the club shorty stays real into me
A humble dude and never will pretend to be
The type of artist that's desired for the industry
Came in this fucka me and I'm a leave me
And in the end B you would believe me that I'm a leave me
So what's a industry if the listeners will always stand beside me?

Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down
Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Here we come yo, here we come

Gather around, the Renissance man has finally appeared
And I'm astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul
They are the reason MCs but none on the level
Other you're the vocalist, precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing inpure emcees, plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

Rap, Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap
It is the Renaissance rap

Now lookin at ya clock, you know that it's time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P
That be G-O-D, and I be T-I-P
The promoter of the flyness, witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness
Don't'cha ever forget, who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suh'thin that you can't recover up from
You better a-joinin the force because we can't be done
Listen, we on this mission and it's a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo
It's the Renaissance;;Money
Money

Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust

They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money

So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd

They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but

If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it

You do anything for money

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
'Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it

You do anything for money

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you

Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God
Then you will hell him

You do anything for money

Anything

Would lie for you

You got to be startin' something

Until you hear her say

Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,
Ma ma coo sa [Repeat x10]

Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin',
You got to be startin' somethin'.
I said you wanna be startin' somethin',
You got to be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying
Talkin', squealin', lyin you got my baby crying

[Chorus]

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over, (YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)

Its getting lil' crazy (its getting crazy)
Always messin' with my baby(messing with my baby)
And thats the reason she cries
Cause when I am not by her side
I had the loneliest night (without my baby)
But I love how you (you)
Always pop up when I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I wanna bring back that night we shared 
And that look on your face
When you say!

[Chorus]

It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA)
It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA)
Too low to get under(YEA YEA)
You're stuck in the middle(YEA YEA)
And the pain is thunder(YEA YEA) [x2];I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost and passed away
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going know her way

There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only
Oh, oh
(I see you love me) 

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have brighten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye you today

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know there's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me want to sing
For you only;You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window, I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind
He said

Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me

Well, I screamed and I hollered, I was so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half past three
She said I'd like to know what you want with me
I said

Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me

Well, I said tell me baby, what's wrong with you?
From this day on our romance is through
I said, tell me baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?
She said

Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me

Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The women may come and the women may go
But before I say I love you so
I want

Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me

;When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (live it off the wall)

You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud
If you take the chance and do it
There there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all

Live your life off the wall (live it off the wall)

Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules it's up to you (ain't no rules it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (all right)

Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Want to see an exhibition
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you

Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall;I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you 
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain'ts scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean

Protection 
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for them to get by
It's black, it's white, (x3) whoo;Stop na na na, you'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!

When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It.
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit.

When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing!

Stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone.
You'd better stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone.

I'm the one who loves you!
I'm the one you need!

Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed!

They'll ruin your reputation!
They'll label you a flirt!

The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh!

Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chimes.
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times!

Stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone.
You'd better stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone.

Slow down.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Slow down.

S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"

The love you save may be your own
Some day you may be all alone
Stop it!
Save it, girl!
Baby, ooh!
You better stop, the love you save may be your own
Please, please
Or some day, some day baby,
You'll be all alone

I'm the one who loves you!
I'm the one you need!

Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed. (Ah!)

Stop, the love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it girl!
Or someday you'll be all alone.

The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt.

Stop, he love you save may be your own!
Don't you know don't you know.
Some day baby you'll be all alone. (Wait a while)

Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed.

Stop, the love you save may be your own!;Ah I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feel sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feels sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart feels sad

Oh, black cruel signing up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And if the world baby nothing's right
Since you've been gone baby
Can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart feel sad, love's gone bad

Ow

Aw, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Aw! ow

Oh, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Aw!
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Come on!;Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, "I love you";Go on girl!

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever
Like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk,
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel

I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

Ain't nobody's business,

(The way you make me fell)
Ain't nobody's business,
Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby
(You really turn me on)

Give it to me, give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl, I want to
Be with mine

Ain't nobody's business but
Mine and my baby's
Go on girl! Aaow!

(My lonely days are gone);Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there

She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair;She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away;Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon;My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

(Huh-ooh)

I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that keeps me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How did I get through this storm
(I can't make it another day without your love)

(Hoo hoo)
(Come on now!)

At night, 
I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
(finding you)
I've opened up my heart I want you to come through
I've close my eyes I'm searching for your love

;If n' I was God, well, just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If' n' I was God, I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks who would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If n' I was God, I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven I would do
If n' I were You

If n' I was God, I'd make us wise
Everybody touch everybody's hand
Reach out and touch somebody's hand

You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody

In this almighty cage 
We shop through the yellow page 
Gone is the corner store 
There is a supermarket there for you 

But feelings remain the same 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
Well it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 

It's a new day, a new age 
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later 
Cars are bigger and better 
Manufacture satisfy
Any world full of crime 
I can't let you take

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 
No, no 

So you want to be a star 
I think you are 
You don't have to go further 
Then my loving arms 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

Are you sure you want to go to New York City (New York City) 
Where girls make it big if their pretty (if their pretty) 
Let say you get that penthouse view 
But whose gonna love you the way I do (just the way I do) 

It's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
No, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

Too late, too late;Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I found my happiest days when you came to see your grandma in May.
I bumped into you at the corner store;
I told you that you sure looked good, now.
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
Your grandma's house was next to mine,
we were together most of the time.
But summer's gotten away from us;
time's moving too fast for us.
 
Bye, bye, don't turn around, 'cause you might see me cry.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
When you return to your hometown,
And discuss your trip,
Will I be the guy that you put down,
Or someone that you won't forget, no?
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I'll never forget you,
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby;
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
 
If you remember my name, drop a line sometime.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.

To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
He tries to explain, "you're what makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand (don't let go of my hand)

Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos;I'm gonna make a change,
For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you want to make the world a better place)

(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!
(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
(Ooh)
Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it,
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!

You got to not let yourself

That man, that man

You've got to move! Come on!

Gonna make that change

Come on!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it
(Change)
Make that change.;Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul

In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood

Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste

Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue

Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul

Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you;Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The systems in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is what I need
From the electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They realize on my name, and push from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you
I can do what I want to

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way

Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape

When I go, this problem world won't bother me no more

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Xscape

Xscape;I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it

Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just wanna scream

I'm tired of you telling the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it
You keep changing up rules, while I keep playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane

With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
So Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (all the injustice)

With such delusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream (stop your pressure);Get down, it's saturday night.

God bless you;Tonight's story is somewhat unique 
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? 
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (everywhere)
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (no, no)

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never land, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened

You should be 
Feel threatened
While you sleep
Be threatened
Every time 
Threatened
Half of me 
So you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed 
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning;Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')

You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart;Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian soul
What do we get, she runs away
What about love?
What about all I pray

Don't know the worst, she knows a atheist
What about God?
Living is all I see
What do you get, things she would say
What about love?
That's all I pray

Sister confused, she went alone
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding a life, reading the words
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse

Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse

You know the lie, you keep it low
What about heart?

On how you feel
One blow to the head is all you need

Cheater;Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

A treasure time won't steal away

Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams

And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you'll always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear od dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life

Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time

Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word

But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go

And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at fall;Baby, love never felt so good

Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her

Save me (cause I don't wanna know)

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do it that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

(That way) Why why
(That way) Why why

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why;There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy
If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there
Should you write and it's not there
Call on me
(Call on me) 

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me;I don't know what's going happen to you, baby

The systems in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is what I need
From the electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They realize on my name, and push from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you
I can do what I want to

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way

Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape

When I go, this problem world won't bother me no more

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today

Maria after all you were the only one
Come on back to me Maria

Hey hey Maria

If you're on that lonely night
What's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you darling my life is through
Come on back
;People 
('Round and 'round and around)
People make the world go 'round
('Round and 'round and around)

Teachers on strike, no more school today
They want more money but the board won't pay
People
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
People

[Chorus]
But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men
People make the world go round

Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a Hippy if you have long hair
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality

[Chorus: x2];To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds or fame
Nor set the pace for style

If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else

For without compromise, shall flower the fruit of constant care

In my eleventh hour, I'll be a man when
To face whatever falls my way
Prepare that utter shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named

A man and woman's youngest son
While growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile

Proud

;Do you remember 
When we fell in love
We were so young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
(Tell me)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby!

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Remember the times
Ooh
Remember the times
Do you remember girl
Remember the times
On the phone you and me
Remember the times
Till dawn, two or three
What about us girl

Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
In the park, on the beach
Remember the times
You and me in Spain
Remember the times
What about, what about...

Remember the times
Ooh...in the park
Remember the times
After dark...Do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Yeah yeah;[Chorus]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Chorus]

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Chorus]

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

[Chorus];One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there;Yeah Shoo-hee

Wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me

One sweet night
I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you

"Thank you"

Promise me
We'll always be
Walking the world together

Hand in hand
Where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye

Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me;(1,2,3)

Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine

Alright that's fine
That's it;Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where there will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry;I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

I never would've thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me

An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (She was loving me)

Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

Loving me while she was still your wife (She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why, oh no
Alright
Oh (I'm in love, love)

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holding her blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone (Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (Holding her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me (Holding her to blame)

Will.i.am non-stop
Mj on top;When this old world gets you down 
When your spirit's on the ground 
Just remember I will always be around 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
When you're feeling all alone 
Like a child who's got no home 
You know you've always got a place where you can go 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

'Til you break those ties that bind 
'Til that day you're really mine 
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

We've got rainbows yet to find 
And we'll find them all in time 
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Yes remember I will always be around 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love;I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

[Chorus]
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
(He say) Pull over boy and get your ticket right

And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

[Chorus]

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like
For me there's no tomorrow

Go! Go! Go! Aaow!

[Chorus];It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
You got me falling in love, got me falling in love

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause 

No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night, all night

And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying come and do me

Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again 

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry;[girl] Next

Whatever you want it's yours
And if I ain't got it, I'll get more
Whether inside or in stores
I want to be what you're looking for

So you say you want a resume, references
Contacts on relationships
How many kids is it
Where do I work, what do I do

What makes me deserve a woman like you
I work hard, play hard
Lace soft but stay hard
I'll sacrifice to please you
Mami, I'm tryin' to see you

[Chorus]

Now, I'm a damn good man with some damn good love
Trying to find someone to give it to, yeah
(oh yeah?)
And I'm down to lace it on you

Give me the time and the place
Just show you face
Show me the line in the race
I'll be your ace

I just want to love you
Give me the chance to show you, I want you

[Chorus]

So listen here love, you get what you ask for
Material things are smaller'n me 'cause I offer more
And won't why'all fool the teacher when I say this
Willing to do what it takes honey

Just to get in the mix with you
So listen, boo, picture me and you
Candlelight dinner for two, romantic rondevous
You only live once, don't miss a chance of a lifetime

You want the world and I'll give it
Because it's all mine

There's a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs

Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you want to see
It's you who's haunting me
You're warning me
To be the stranger
In your life

Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast

And if you want to see
Eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eyes

There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light

But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart

So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh

Am I scary for you
So tell me is it scary for you, baby
So tell me is it crazy for you, baby

Is the height of haunting souls

Am I scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
So tell me am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for ya, baby

And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there)

(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)

(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed);Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Oh. oh, oh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Oh, summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with the unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me, more summer wine
Woh, woh, oh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Mm, summer wine

When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me craving for, more summer wine
Oh, oh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs, help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Oh, oh, summer wine;Akon and MJ, oh, yeah, yeah

(Hold my hand);Now I'm just wondering 
Why you think that you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through
I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me (come on)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes (yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (I'm too much for you baby)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (you can't break me)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (you can't touch me)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (yeah)
You'll never break me
You can't let it break, 'cause I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm (uh) unbreakable (uh, what? uh)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello?
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack bragging, sick of bragging how my mink be dragging
Desert Eag's, street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil
What

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (yeah)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (yeah)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (you, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (woo)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it, babe, 'cause I'm unbreakable (woo)

Gone;All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch you

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I;I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watchin' snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that waiting there is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(And I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you have to leave me)

Oh, little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve;Maria hey hey Maria 
Maria don't you hear me calling Maria 
Maria girl you know you were the only one 
Hey hey Maria 

Maria don't you miss me just a little 
Maria after all you were the only one 
Come on back to me Maria 
Maria come on back to me girl 
Hey hey Maria 

Maria it's been long so long 
Maria since you've been gone 
Hey hey Maria

Maria 'cause honest girl you were the only one 
Come on back to me Maria 
Oh come on back to me girl 

Maria I need you 
Maria why d'you keep a-running away 
Oh baby you keep a-running away 
Oh baby yeah Maria 
I need you honey 
Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower 
Oh hear my plea for sympathy 
I just want you here with me Maria 
If you're on that lonely night 
What's my life without you girl 
I'm so lonely I'm so blue 
Without you darling my life is through 
Come on back;It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller, tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller at night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul
Would ever dare try
This is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller chiller
Thriller here tonight

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul
Could ever dare try
This is thriller, thriller night
Girl so let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller;My pocket were full and now my money's gone
My friends come around and now they're gone
Things come and they come and then they go
And where they go nobody knows

[Chorus]
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around
It's gonna come around
What goes around comes around

My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace
Yet people push bullshit in my face
The future can't hold what your money can't buy
My brother keep striving your child relies

[Chorus]

The world keep on spinning does the future know? 
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow
We've ruined what's pure down from nature below? 
You'd better look back it'll all be gone

[Chorus]

So children please listen this world is yours
This message to deep to ignore
Your forefathers said but they did not do
The things that would show that they cared for you

[Chorus]

Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around, comes around, comes around
Comes around yeah

Gonna take you higher
I'm gonna take you higher
I'm gonna take you higher
Yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna take you higher
Gonna take you higher
Yeah yeah yeah

Gonna take you higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Gonna take you higher
Gonna take you higher;When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
 
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend;Evil, why have you engulfed so many hearts, evil
Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide

Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred
Evil, why have you stolen so much love
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free

Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes, evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world evil
Evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes
Leaving sweet love alone and outcast of the world;We're gonna change our style
Bring on a brand new style
We're gonna make funky music
Swing to a brand new beat
One that is more unique
Listen to the music
Go wow, go wow

He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around;Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problems, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't want to save me, sad is my song

When you believe in things you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no;She's there just sitting at the table
Thinking out that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me
And she answered "no" to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me
And she answered "no" to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would dimly go

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon.;Everybody's somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one you above

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool;Hallelujah day,

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever
Like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk,
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever
From miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side

Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel

I never felt so in love before
Promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus: x2]

Ain't nobody's business,
ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me fell)
Ain't nobody's business,
Ain't nobody's business but
mine and my baby
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me, give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl, I want to
be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but

Go on girl!
(My lonely days are gone)

Chika, chika
Chika, chika, chika

(The way you make me feel)
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)

(The way you make me feel)
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone);As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
Nothing to fear fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
La la la
A place without no name
La la la

A place without no name (La, la, la);Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face

You call me in a state of shock
Look at that, look at me, look at me, look at me
Look at me, oh, look at me;There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
A better way for us to survive
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this;It's close to midnight 
And something evil's lurking in the dark

They will possess you 
Unless you change that number on your dial

And rot inside a corpse's shell

(Nobody else can need you)
No more than the one whose heart you won't believe

So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (my love)
That you're my love, baby (my only love)
I'll do it, yes I'd do it
To show I love you

In your eyes
I see no faith
There's an absence of trust
In your embrace

But why would I
Pretend to give
Just to take from the person
For whom I live

(I told you that I love you)
(especially I need you)
You're one love in a million was made from the stars
(And maybe you'd believe me)
(Then maybe you would need me)
But maybe may not ever convince your stubborn heart

[Chorus:]
So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (my love)
You're my love, baby (my only love)
I'd do it, and I'll do it, yes I'll do it for you
And if I have to stop a river
To make you belive that I'm the one (the one)
That special one you need (that special one)
I'd do it, yes I'd do it (to show I love you)

(Pins and needles sticking in my heart)
(We're so close, but still so far apart)
(What to do, what to do to make you need my love too)

[Chorus];There you were
Standing there
As your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love I never knew
I found in you
Suddenly
My world stood still
My life was then forfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laying a plan
For everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)
It came today
Forever came today

As we were standing there
You didn't speak a single word
But your eyes
Your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darling
Ooh, my darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has let me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our hapiness
Thanks to you my search has ended
And I want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)
It came today
Forever came today
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (A paradise)
Oh, it came today
Forever came today
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life
;Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby please, 'cause it's not worth it

You came into my life
And it's so funny
How you made everything right
And now you're saying to me
Something ain't right
What did I do?
Did I hurt you?
Baby can you tell me
How to dry your eyes
But let me say
I never meant to make you cry
If anything I meant to
Be right by your side
How did I go wrong?
When my love was strong
And all I ever wanted was you

If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

[Chorus: x2]
Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
'Cause it's not worth it

You mean the world to me
And all I do is try to give you all of me
I never do anything that wouldn't be pleasing to you
I never knew that you were hurting
And I'll take the blame for anything that I've done
That has caused you pain
I never meant to hurt you in any way
So this day, I wanna say
Baby please forgive me

If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

[Chorus]

Don't wanna see you this way
What must I do to make it all brand new
Let me take the pain away
Anything for you, 'cause baby I love you

[Chorus];No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams

No broken bridges
Can turn us around
'Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found

[Chorus]
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
Just one more step
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
'Cause we're almost there

Look at the lovers
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
Life's long hard climb
They just couldn't take it
They just couldn't take it

Don't let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darlin'
We'll make it through

Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
Keep on reachin', do it for me
Do it for me, cause baby

[Chorus]

We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it 
Can't afford to waste it

Need to feel your hand
Slippin' from mine 
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Keep on tryin'

[Chorus]

Baby baby, don't give up
'Cause we're almost there) 
Keep on, keep on
We're almost there) 
Just one more step
'Cause we're almost there) 
Cause we're almost there

Just one more step
Cause we're almost there
We've come to far
To turn around

Oh! 

Keep on reachin'
For higher ground
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Turn us around

Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there

Everything we're lookin' for
We're almost there
Keep on reachin' out for me

Cause we're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there

Ah we're almost there;I don't know what's gonna happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love you
You walk around this town

Take it over

Down, down, down, down
Take it over;If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me

If'n I was God
I'd make us wise 
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone

And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you
If'n I was God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand;Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
What does it mean
Kicking me down
I gotta get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks

Peek in the shadow
Come into the light

You're sellin' out souls but

I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

You know I do really hate to say it
The government don't want to see

When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while 

Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along 
Thanks to you I finally got a song, 

[Chorus]
'Cause you are there, 
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it's falling down 
Things look up just having you around
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You're the answer to the prayers I say, 

And you are there, 
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it trough, 
So every night I say a prayer, 
Just because you're there

Oh, you are there, 
Oh, you are there, somewhere
And as the years go by we'll stay as true, 
What you are for me I'll be for you
And every night I'll say a prayer, 
Just because you're there, 

Oh, you are there, 
Oh, you are there, 
Everywhere, you are there;I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your ticket right"

And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go

I gotta really burn this road

Gonna live each day and hour like
For me there's no tomorrow

Go! Go! Go! Go! Aaow!

A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue

Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood

Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you.;Bm, bm, bm, bm, bm
You send cold chills
Up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills
Then you draw the line
Oh baby
(Oh baby)

'Cause your mama told you
That love ain't right
But don't you know
Good lovin' is the spice of life? Yeah
Mama's pearls, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin' 
(What you been missin')

Ooh, ooh, now baby

Too late? Sure
Eat this

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white;She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away;Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone;Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed by my side
You make the sun shine

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you;Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need

Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So don't send no doctor to my door
'Cause Doctor John been here before
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Bring your loving and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a, 
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away;All along I had to talk about it
But like a two edged sword,
He touched you and it stabs

All along I knew you were
A phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world

You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth but that's your hiding place
You say you love me but its hard to see
Cause when he's in your arms,
Your throwing rocks at me
Who do you love?
Is it me?
Well, I don't know
Who do you love?
That I want
If you had
If you knew me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just steady in my mind)

I walk around I'm sufferin'
In my doom
When I come to you,
You're sittin' in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face
Who do you love?

Is it me?
Well, I don't know
Who do you love?
That I want ya
If you had
I know you

(Heaven must be weary)
Heaven must be weary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
?
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be weary)
Heaven must be weary
(Your smile is scary)
You know ooh, babe
(Insincere, empty tears)
?
Na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me?
Well, I don't know
Who do you love?
Gotta want ya
If he had
I know you

Who do you love?
Is it me?
Well,
I don't know
Who do you love?
God I want ya
If he can
I don't know
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it);No sense pretending it's over/Hard times just don't go away,
You've got to take that chip off your shoulder/It's time you open up, have some faith
Nothin' good ever comes easy/All good things come in due time (yes it does)/
You've gotta have something to believe in/I'm telling you to open your mind (hee-eee-eee)
Chorus: You've gotta put your heart on the line, if you want to make it right/
You've got to reach out and try. Gotta put your heart on the line, if you want to get it right/Gotta put it all on the line.
You see yourself in the mirror/And if you don't like what you see, no/And things aren't getting much clearer/
Don't you think it's time you go for a change, (oh oh)/Don't waste you time on the past (no no)/ It's time you look to the future (oh oh)/
It's all right there if you ask/This time if you try much harder/You'll be the best that you can be!(oh,ohhh oh)
[Chorus]
If you want to make it right/And you want to do it now/Then you've got to learn to try/
And to make it work somehow/Don't a lot in life come free/And that's just the way it is now/
You've got to go for what you want/You've got to know it, You've got to live it (OH!)
[Chorus]. . .(On the line) (you and me) (whoo!) (whoo!) (you and me!)
(gotta put it all, gotta put it all) (whoo!) (Hee!);If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry

You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you
To grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words:

No wind, (no wind)
No rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe
(Oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal

No wind, (no wind)
No rain, (no rain)
Can stop me, babe
If you wanna go

I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
(Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough (no)
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
(Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you

(Ain't no mountain high enough)
Nothing in this world
(Ain't no valley low enough)
Nothing in this world
Can keep me from you, baby
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
Just call my name
I'll be there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
(Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you;Where have I been? 
What should i be looking for? 
What am I gonna be when I come of age? 
Will I be strong? 
Will I be a mighty man
Climb mountains if I can
When I come of age? 

Hey y'all I think I'll be a movie star
Or travel to some distant star
Yeah that's it I'm gonna be an astronaut
And rock it to the moon
And then I'll be the captain of a giant ship
I'm gonna take a long, long trip to far off land
When I become a man

And what about love? 
Will you still be in love with me? 
I sure hope you will be
When I come of age
And will you be true? 
Will you still want to marry me? 
I guess I'll have to wait and see
When I come of age

My folks say I'm too young for love
But they don't seem to understand
That what I feel is love for somebody
A feeling I understand
And while I've fot this feeling
It's you, girl, you're so grand
And I'll love you girl just as strong
When I come of age

Wait, be patient honey
You've got to believe in me
Wait, wait for me baby
It'll be just you and me
We'll do all the things
We couldn't do before
When when I come of age
We're gonna be so happy
When, when I come of age;Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I want to come home again
I want you to

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I'm on my way back to you
And I want to make it up to you
And all the problems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me;She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promising,
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,
She works in a restaurant, night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside every time she feels this way,
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no

Keepin' your head up to the sky,
Keepin' your mind up stay alive,
Gimme your wings so we can fly,
(Keep your head up tonight)

Keepin' your head up to the sky,
And we can just rise up tell me now,
Gimme your wings so we can fly

And we're sucking up the air in the earth from under me,

(Oh keep) Keep your head up don't give up today,
How long can we wait?

Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl
You came and you changed my world
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says
"Do you love me"
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"

(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)
(I love you too-I want you too-my love)

(Naku penda piya-naku taka piya-mpenziwe)
(I love you too-I want you too-my love)

Liberian girl
You know that you came

I wait for the day
When you have to say
"I do"
And I'll smile and say it too,
I love you, Liberian girl, all the time

(Girl)
Ooh! I love you baby, I want you baby, ooh!
(Girl);There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul that snaps my control
It's a funny thing but every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me your slave

Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
(Anything that you want to do)
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see Heaven in your eyes
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you, baby come here
Don't have no fear, oh, is there wonder why?
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again 
So baby won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery?

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me? Oh baby please
Pull yourself together, got to do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling

Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so crazy mama
Never knew what love was all about

James Moody would you come out here?
You can blow now if you want to, we're through;I was born by the river in a little tent
And just like the river, I've been running ever since
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come

I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me "Don't hang around"
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come

Then I go to my brother and I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up knocking me back down on my knees

There've been times that I've thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come;Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says what's going on?
Mother cries desperately, our little baby's gone!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause I don't wanna know)
Save me ('cause I'm tired and unfed)
Save me ('cause his because of you )
Save me (I'm on the bed)
Save me ('cause I don't want no more)
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause terror arrived )
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Just imagine how scared they are;To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need no conquered worlds, a flame
Not set, the paceful style

If I can follow through
Oh, love think wavely me as my tears
I'll find the way to sell my clothes
Avoiding ships a fuss

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I dare not to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise, 
Shall follow the feel of constant care) 

In my eleven hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever force my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just recall the part of guide

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
Who are growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...

Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies

Things you've done to me, are coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you've done to me

The blue gangsta;This is not your ordinary record

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things
Kids are murderin' other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist they put a gun in it
want to be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy, you know it's killing me

So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encaged like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
And peace of mind is hard to find

I want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place, no substitution for restitution
The only solution for peace is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach
When all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds
We all must unite
To turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love
We're disrespecting each other
What happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world
Already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The pressure's building and I've had enough

I want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now
Shout

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place, no substitution for restitution
The only solution for peace is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

Throw my hands up and shout

Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
You know it makes me want to shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me want to shout
Come on, now
Shout;You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine;The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine;Searching
Been looking everywhere
Soon I'll find you, girl
I know I'm getting closer now
Can't wait to hold you, girl

The day I find you, girl, you'll love me

Hey, girl

You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you want to be bad

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love

Tell me what's goin' down, babe

Every time I want to say it, it is
Just too much for me
I don't ever want to say it cause of
All the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
Don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother in law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
I caught your mother, she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down

Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
Don't be callin' out "mercy me" (Don't be callin' out "mercy me")

I read the paper and I can't believe what's goin' round

The government won't pay my taxes and I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me

Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother in law

I caught your mother, she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you

Your brother didn't make a nickle, or dime too
Sittin' around tellin' how he did it to you

Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile;Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
There's something about you, I stare in your eyes
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

We fought in a battle, nobody won
And left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

You'll try everything you never thought of before
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all
You can always give up some more
Nothing means anything unless you're here with me
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again

I want to spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I want to fall with you again;She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)
 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
She says I am the one, 
(you know what you did, (she says he is my son)breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover;I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh oh (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh oh (hey baby);It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters

She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming?

Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, strike a flame in me

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(It's heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey

It's torture
It's torture
It's torture

(When you call my name)
It's torture
(Heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey;Close my eyes and I see your face at night
Toss and turn, fall to sleep holding my pillow tight
All the time I think of you
You're with me no matter what I do

Walk around with a smile upon my face
In my mind you have taken up permanent space
I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
And fall in love

S-E-R-I-O-U-S, baby
Let's get serious
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

In your arms is the place I want to be
With my love in you and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much love we want to share

Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious
And fall in love

Let's get serious;Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs 
She only knows how low that she can go 
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
Only for me, then spoke with her body 
Her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right thriough her 
She's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
And she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right thriough her she's a heartbreaker 

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
Stop being without you 
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
And start being without you 
But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
And stop talkin' about you 
And what will she say? 
They will say I was the man that got away 

I can't blame her
I thought it was love, but it's game huh?
When you're dealing with the emotions, it's pain ma
Take a closer look when your dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, no
Heart murder in place then you'll see
It won't heal from Pepsi they see
Ball hard player, she's a star player
I need Liz Cracker
I ain't seen the heartbreaker, so come on

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 

That girl I
Should have known she was a 
That girl I 
Should've seen right through her
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should've seen right through her she's a heartbreaker;Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are my life;[Chorus]
Why does Monday come before Tuesday
Why do summers start in June
Why do winters come too soon
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up, oh why

Why do I love you, tell me why

It's not like I can explain what's in my heart
It's just I feel a crazy pain with we're apart
I don't want to breathe
I don't want to think
I don't want to love
I don't want to do anything

It's not like I can't describe what's going on
It's just I feel I'm not alive when your not home
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to be
I just want you here beside me
Without you there's no me

[Chorus]

Why do we love if love will die

Why does Wednesday come after Tuesday
Why do flowers come in May
Why does springtime go away
Why do people fall in love
When they're always breaking up
Oh why

Why do I love you, tell me why

It's not like I can escape what's in my soul
'Cause with you inside my heart where can I go
I don't want to see
No you without me
I can't go through life without you
Without you there's no me

[Chorus]

Why do we love if love will die?

Why do the rivers flow to the sea
Even if it flows
Why can't your love flow to me, babe
Why does my heart feel sadness
To be in love, to feel your love
Why don't I feel complete

[Chorus]

Why do I love you, tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell my why
Tell my why;When we were tiny little boys
We use to dance, we use to sing
Before we even learned to crawl or walk
As we grew up we didn't change
I guess we knew right from the start
We'd loved the spotlight and the stage
Cause we were born to entertain
And when we walk out on the stage
The way we feel deep inside
Is something magic when the music starts to play
We want to bring a little happiness and love into your lives
Forget about your problems and your troubles for a little while
We're here to entertain you 
On stage right now
We're here to entertain you 
Right here, right now
We like to dance, we like to sing
And do our thing
We like to dance, we like to sing
We like to do our thing
There's no business
Like show business
There's no business
Like show business
We're here to entertain you 
On stage right now
We're here to entertain you
Right here, right now
On stage right now
Right here, right now
On stage right now;Man, oh, man, how glad I am
To have that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
Talkin' about that girl
She's good, she's good, she's good to me, yeah

Boy, oh boy, loads of joy
Every time she comes to mind, my friend
Talkin' about that girl
She's good, she's good, she's good to me, yeah

(She's good, she's good)
Don't you know I'm in heaven now?
And my little dream, is this really real?
I'm scared to pinch myself to find out

My, oh my, it's heard to realize
That something so groovy could be mine
Talkin' about that girl
She's good, she's good, she's good to me, yeah

(She's good, she's good)
Don't you know that the world is mine?
And my little dream, is this really real?
I'm scared to pinch myself to find out

Man, oh man (she's good, she's good)
Boy, oh boy (she's good, she's good)
Don't you know that she's good to me
She's good, she's good, she's so good to me
And I love her (she's good, she's good) oh
(She's good, she's good)
She's so good;La la la la la la, la la la la la la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la;Can you remember
When we were babies?
We were always together
When we were kindergartners.

Now that you're grown, girl,
You left me all alone.
And you know I'll never find
No one to call my own.

So, girl, I love you, I love you
Don't you know I love you?

My Cherie, like for you
To remember if you can
Times we had and the time we shared
Sitting there in the grass.

Can you remember
When we were babies?
We were always together
And I never had no one but you.

When sunny skies are blue, girl,
You'll know that I love you.
And I'll always promise you
That this is what I'll do.

So, girl, I love you, I love you
Don't you know I love you?
 
My Cherie, like for you
To remember if you can
Times we had and the time we shared
Sitting there in the grass.;All alone she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doing wrong
On the move got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the news

You're living on sunset time
(Uuh)

Feeling bad
You're living much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breaking every law

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

On the go
Got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Living hot, doing what you should not
The break is on me then what do you got
We're living on sunset time

(Want that dime)

Shoot the breeze
You feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you wanna be
Who's to trust when living dangerous
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Getting higher
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

(Uuh)
(Pah dah dah dah)

You are there when the night's in town
Standing there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema
You think there's nothing wrong

Going town
You do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon
Gotta fever in your shoes
The night's on you
What are you gonna do?

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

You re my friend
Carry me, like you are my brother
Love me like a mother

Weary, tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you hold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human (instru.)

Seems that the world's
Got a role for me I'm so confused

On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be;If I don't love you this way
If I don't love you this way

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say, yeah
If I don't need you this much 
Why do I ache for your touch, yeah

With you it seems
I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you it seems 
Still don't believe
How valuable you are
I'm really loving you 
Not pretending to

If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong, yeah
How can you doubt that I care
When I'm with you everywhere, yeah

They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me

You got school teachers
Who don't want to teach
You got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

Why you want to trip on me
Why you want to trip on me
Stop trippin'

We've got more problems
Than we'll ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet

We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walkin' into darkness
Tell me
What are we doing
To try to stop this

Why you want to trip on me [Repeat: x4]
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Why you want to trip on me [Repeat: x4]
Stop trippin'

Why you want to trip on me [Repeat: x4]
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Stop trippin' [Repeat: x4];Why don't you believe me when I say that i love you? 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
You wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true 
I'm all about you 
You're my desire 
I get higher every time I speak your name 
That's all I do 
And the way that I can't sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don't love, when it's giving my love pains 
It's the hurt and the tension 
Girl, it's driving me insane 
 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
 
Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
I'm here to love and please you, I'll do what you want me to 
I'm all about you 
Living and hoping, but I'm coping 
With these things you put me through 
That's all I do 
The way that I can't sleep at night 
Just proves what I go through 
I'm crazy 'bout you 
 
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty, 
Gone with your bad self 
Now you say that I don't love, when it's giving my love pains

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one 
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one;Give me some joyful jukebox music
And some genuine alligator shoes
Give me a Chevrolet car and a honky tonk bar
It's a rhythm that I can't refuse
Give me a quarter for that jukebox
So I can play my favorite song
Give me a touch of the past so we can bop so fast
And everybody sing along
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Are you ready (are you ready)
Ready (are you ready)
To boogie down and lose control
Play that record again for me
The one with the rock n' roll melody
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories
(2nd chorus)
Remember when you saw the beatles
And heard the music of the rolling stones
Well baby we'll be rollin' in at seven in a make believe heaven
The good ol' days have aged my bones
(1st chorus)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Are you ready (are you ready)
Remember how to rock n' roll
Just make me a believer in rock n' roll fever
And bring back the memories, oh yeah
One more time
Give some joyful jukebox music
That gets me out on the dancin' floor
Give me a Saturday night to hold my baby tight
And watch me shake it up once more
(2nd chorus)

That you walked into my life
It was just the kind of thing, 
That was soo right on time
After all that love changes, 
My heart had locked the door
Then that gurl released her magic 
And made me love once more
 
Like the warm rays of the sun her sweet love 
Keeps shining down on me, 
Oh oh, only one turned 
Why life around and wit one kiss she set me free

She's given me joy, joy, joy
That gurl she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy 
She brings me joy

Goodbye to loneliness, 
And so long to my heartache,
Now that joy has taken over, 
And decided to stay
Her love lifts me up, 
Like no other love before, 
With every beat of my heart, 
I'm holding on, hey

Just look what she's done for me, 
Just erased all the sadness away, oh oh oh, 
I could never repay her debt, 
'Cause she keeps loving me more and more

She's given me joy, joy, joy
That gurl she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Like numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe its because we're so versatile
Style, profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From The Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile
Well if you battle me I feel reviled
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gaul, you've got guile
If you step to me I'm going to rap full file
If you want to battle you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead with my rhymes I'll trial
Cast you off into exile

Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend

Well I have to keep it going keep it going full steam
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme
Mario see likes to keep it clean
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin', cause that's my dream

We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
Cause the music is loud like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gets biz on the crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
"MMM, D-are-are-rop!"
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack DJ AD Rock!
If you try to knock me you'll get mopped
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

And see the world with your heart

Feeling the world standing still
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Living the way that you choose
Healthily and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give euphoria invitation

One more chance at love;As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Woah oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
There's no in fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
Grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
We're in a world that I wanna lead

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name;All my friends keep asking what do I see in you
Through their eyes you beauty doesn't show
Ooh, all they ask is justified looking through the naked eye
But through the eyes of my love I see
The inner beauty of you

That's why you're my little baby
That's why you're my little baby
I don't want love on the skin
It's got to come from deep within
That's why you're my little baby
My little baby
My heart controls my eyes
And your love I visualize, oh yeah!

All your so-called girl friends who compliment your clothes
Know that they're you mama's hand-me-downs
Ooh, the fashion world's turning so fast
You're still trying to catch the past.
But in my world of love your style
I know will always last.

That's why you're my little baby
That's why you're my little baby

Our love is tailor-made
That's why you're my little baby

I am the moonlight

When things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun that lights summer sky,
When things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back,

When things would hurt you
